%if you would like to use this code, please feel free, just remember to
%reference and tell your friends! :)
%requires matlabs image processing toolbox


%What the heck does this code do!?
%the code finds the hexbug buy using a series of basic, but effective
%images processing techniques (formal talk for a second -->) :
% 1) Averaged background subtraction
% 2) Noise reduction via image smoothing using 2-d gaussian filter.
% 3) Threshold and point detection in binary image.

%% make average of background images (i.e. images with no objects of interest)
% Here we just read in a set of images (N) and then take the average of
% them so that we are confident we got a good model of what the background
% looks like (i.e. a template free from any potential weird image artifacts

N = 20; % num of frames to use to make averaged background...that is, images with no bug!
img = zeros(288,352,N); %define image stack for averaging (if you don't know what this is, just load the image and  check it with size())
for i = 1:N    
    img_tmp = imread(f_list(i).name); %read in the given image
    img(:,:,i) = img_tmp(:,:,1); % we don't really care about the rgb image values, so we just take the first dimension of the image
end
bck_img = (mean(img,3)); %take the average across the image stack..and bingo! there's your background template!

%over the image to smooth it.

    %quick solution for finding center of mass for a BINARY image
    %basically, just get indices of all locations above threshold (1) and
    %take the average, for both the x and y directions. This will give you
    %the average location in each dimension, and hence the center of the
    %bug..unless of course, something else (like my hand) passes threshold
    %:P  
    %if doesn't find anything, it randomly picks a pixel
    [x,y] = find (thres_img);    
    if ~isempty(x)
        CM_idx(i,:) = ceil([mean(x) mean(y)]+1); % i used ceiling to avoid zero indices, but it makes the system SLIGHTLY biased, meh, no biggie, not the point here :).
